# Parallel_and_Distributed_Programming


I wrote a simulator by creating multiple threads to represent people accessing the platform. A platform has space for at most 100 people at any one time. People are only admitted when the platform is open and the number of persons does not exceed the prescribed limit. Using condition variables I wrote a class that could be used to control access to the platform.
